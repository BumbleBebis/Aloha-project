# Aloha-project
Project 1: Aloha Homepage

# Emma Van Eeckhout

## What I have learned:
This webpage was created as an assignment for the RED Academy web development course. During the creating of this webpage, I have learned a lot about HTML and CSS such as:

- Working with custom fonts
- Making forms and buttons
- Using typographic properties
- Using flexbox properties and values
- Using an icon font

The project scope was to do the following:
- Create a homepage for your client the Aloha Apparel Co. using HTML and CSS.
- Add interactivity to this website with JS, and implement a mobile-first, responsive layout with flexbox (optimized for the three required screen sizes).
